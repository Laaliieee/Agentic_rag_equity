Segments
The  Company  manages  its  business  primarily  on  a  geographic  basis.  The  Company’s  reportable  segments  consist  of  the 
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong 
and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other reportable 
segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is 
managed separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market 
dynamics of each geographic region.
Markets and Distribution
The Company’s customers are primarily in the consumer, small and mid-sized business, education, enterprise and government 
markets. The Company sells its products and resells third-party products in most of its major markets directly to customers 
through  its  retail  and  online  stores  and  its  direct  sales  force.  The  Company  also  employs  a  variety  of  indirect  distribution 
channels, such as third-party cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and resellers. During 2023, the Company’s net 
sales through its direct and indirect distribution channels accounted for 37% and 63%, respectively, of total net sales.
Competition
The  markets  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services  are  highly  competitive,  and  are  characterized  by  aggressive  price 
competition  and  resulting  downward  pressure  on  gross  margins,  frequent  introduction  of  new  products  and  services,  short 
product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid 
adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses. Many of 
the Company’s competitors seek to compete primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating 
the Company’s products and infringing on its intellectual property.
Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 2
The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative 
new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for 
its  products,  including  the  hardware,  operating  system,  numerous  software  applications  and  related  services.  Principal 
competitive factors important to the Company include price, product and service features (including security features), relative 
price  and  performance,  product  and  service  quality  and  reliability,  design  innovation,  a  strong  third-party  software  and 
accessories ecosystem, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, and corporate reputation.
The Company is focused on expanding its market opportunities related to smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables 
and  accessories,  and  services.  The  Company  faces  substantial  competition  in  these  markets  from  companies  that  have 
significant technical, marketing, distribution and other resources, as well as established hardware, software, and service offerings 
with large customer bases. In addition, some of the Company’s competitors have broader product lines, lower-priced products 
and a larger installed base of active devices. Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut 
prices and lowered product margins. Certain competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products 
at little or no profit or even at a loss. The Company’s services compete with business models that provide content to users for 
free and use illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content and applications. The Company faces significant competition 
as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications within their products, or collaborate to offer integrated 
solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer.
Supply of Components
Although  most  components  essential  to  the  Company’s  business  are  generally  available  from  multiple  sources,  certain 
components are currently obtained from single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with 
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, wearables and accessories. Therefore, many 
components used by the Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry-wide 
shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.
The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced by 
the  Company  often  utilize  custom  components  available  from  only  one  source.  When  a  component  or  product  uses  new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or their manufacturing capacities have 
increased. The continued availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers decide to 
concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.
The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that the 
Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Research and Development
Because the industries in which the Company competes are characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company’s 
ability to compete successfully depends heavily upon its ability to ensure a continual and timely flow of competitive products, 
services  and  technologies  to  the  marketplace.  The  Company  continues  to  develop  new  technologies  to  enhance  existing 
products  and  services,  and  to  expand  the  range  of  its  offerings  through  research  and  development  (“R&D”),  licensing  of 
intellectual property and acquisition of third-party businesses and technology.
Intellectual Property
The Company currently holds a broad collection of intellectual property rights relating to certain aspects of its hardware devices, 
accessories,  software  and  services.  This  includes  patents,  designs,  copyrights,  trademarks  and  other  forms  of  intellectual 
property rights in the U.S. and various foreign countries. Although the Company believes the ownership of such intellectual 
property rights is an important factor in differentiating its business and that its success does depend in part on such ownership, 
the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of its personnel.
The Company regularly files patent, design, copyright and trademark applications to protect innovations arising from its research, 
development,  design  and  marketing,  and  is  currently  pursuing  thousands  of  applications  around  the  world.  Over  time,  the 
Company has accumulated a large portfolio of issued and registered intellectual property rights around the world. No single 
intellectual property right is solely responsible for protecting the Company’s products and services. The Company believes the 
duration of its intellectual property rights is adequate relative to the expected lives of its products and services.
In addition to Company-owned intellectual property, many of the Company’s products and services are designed to include 
intellectual property owned by third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various 
aspects  of  the  Company’s  products,  processes  and  services.  While  the  Company  has  generally  been  able  to  obtain  such 
licenses on commercially reasonable terms in the past, there is no guarantee that such licenses could be obtained in the future 
on reasonable terms or at all.
Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 3
Business Seasonality and Product Introductions
The Company has historically experienced higher net sales in its first quarter compared to other quarters in its fiscal year due in 
part to seasonal holiday demand. Additionally, new product and service introductions can significantly impact net sales, cost of 
sales and operating expenses. The timing of product introductions can also impact the Company’s net sales to its indirect 
distribution channels as these channels are filled with new inventory following a product launch, and channel inventory of an 
older product often declines as the launch of a newer product approaches. Net sales can also be affected when consumers and 
distributors anticipate a product introduction.
Human Capital
The Company believes it has a talented, motivated and dedicated team, and works to create an inclusive, safe and supportive 
environment  for  all  of  its  team  members.  As  of  September  30,  2023,  the  Company  had  approximately  161,000  full-time 
equivalent employees.
Workplace Practices and Policies
The Company is an equal opportunity employer committed to inclusion and diversity and to providing a workplace free of 
harassment or discrimination.
Compensation and Benefits
The Company believes that compensation should be competitive and equitable, and should enable employees to share in the 
Company’s success. The Company recognizes its people are most likely to thrive when they have the resources to meet their 
needs and the time and support to succeed in their professional and personal lives. In support of this, the Company offers a wide 
variety of benefits for employees around the world and invests in tools and resources that are designed to support employees’ 
individual growth and development.
Inclusion and Diversity
The Company is committed to its vision to build and sustain a more inclusive workforce that is representative of the communities 
it serves. The Company continues to work to increase diverse representation at every level, foster an inclusive culture, and 
support equitable pay and access to opportunity for all employees.
Engagement
The Company believes that open and honest communication among team members, managers and leaders helps create an 
open, collaborative work environment where everyone can contribute, grow and succeed. Team members are encouraged to 
come  to  their  managers  with  questions,  feedback  or  concerns,  and  the  Company  conducts  surveys  that  gauge  employee 
sentiment in areas like career development, manager performance and inclusivity.
Health and Safety
The Company is committed to protecting its team members everywhere it operates. The Company identifies potential workplace 
risks in order to develop measures to mitigate possible hazards. The Company supports employees with general safety, security 
and  crisis  management  training,  and  by  putting  specific  programs  in  place  for  those  working  in  potentially  high-hazard 
environments. Additionally, the Company works to protect the safety and security of its team members, visitors and customers 
through its global security team.

Item 1A.  Risk Factors
The Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be affected by a number of 
factors, whether currently known or unknown, including those described below. When any one or more of these risks materialize 
from time to time, the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price can be materially 
and adversely affected.
Because of the following factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company’s results of operations and financial condition, 
past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not 
use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. This discussion of risk factors contains forward-looking 
statements.
This section should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition 
and Results of Operations” and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in Part II, Item 8, “Financial 
Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K.
Macroeconomic and Industry Risks
The  Company’s  operations  and  performance  depend  significantly  on  global  and  regional  economic  conditions  and 
adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations and financial 
condition.
The Company has international operations with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales. 
In addition, the Company’s global supply chain is large and complex and a majority of the Company’s supplier facilities, including 
manufacturing and assembly sites, are located outside the U.S. As a result, the Company’s operations and performance depend 
significantly on global and regional economic conditions.
Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including slow growth or recession, high unemployment, inflation, tighter credit, higher 
interest rates, and currency fluctuations, can adversely impact consumer confidence and spending and materially adversely 
affect demand for the Company’s products and services. In addition, consumer confidence and spending can be materially 
adversely affected in response to changes in fiscal and monetary policy, financial market volatility, declines in income or asset 
values, and other economic factors.
In addition to an adverse impact on demand for the Company’s products and services, uncertainty about, or a decline in, global 
or regional economic conditions can have a significant impact on the Company’s suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics 
providers, distributors, cellular network carriers and other channel partners, and developers. Potential outcomes include financial 
instability; inability to obtain credit to finance business operations; and insolvency.
Adverse economic conditions can also lead to increased credit and collectibility risk on the Company’s trade receivables; the 
failure of derivative counterparties and other financial institutions; limitations on the Company’s ability to issue new debt; reduced 
liquidity;  and  declines  in  the  fair  values  of  the  Company’s  financial  instruments.  These  and  other  impacts  can  materially 
adversely affect the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.
The  Company’s  business  can  be  impacted  by  political  events,  trade  and  other  international  disputes,  war,  terrorism, 
natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents and other business interruptions.
Political events, trade and other international disputes, war, terrorism, natural disasters, public health issues, industrial accidents 
and other business interruptions can harm or disrupt international commerce and the global economy, and could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company and its customers, suppliers, contract manufacturers, logistics providers, distributors, cellular 
network carriers and other channel partners.
Apple Inc. | 2023 Form 10-K | 5
The Company has a large, global business with sales outside the U.S. representing a majority of the Company’s total net sales, 
and  the  Company  believes  that  it  generally  benefits  from  growth  in  international  trade.  Substantially  all  of  the  Company’s 
manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan, South 
Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam. Restrictions on international trade, such as tariffs and other controls on imports or exports of goods, 
technology or data, can materially adversely affect the Company’s operations and supply chain and limit the Company’s ability to 
offer and distribute its products and services to customers. The impact can be particularly significant if these restrictive measures 
apply to countries and regions where the Company derives a significant portion of its revenues and/or has significant supply 
chain  operations.  Restrictive  measures  can  require  the  Company  to  take  various  actions,  including  changing  suppliers, 
restructuring business relationships, and ceasing to offer third-party applications on its platforms. Changing the Company’s 
operations  in  accordance  with  new  or  changed  restrictions  on  international  trade  can  be  expensive,  time-consuming  and 
disruptive to the Company’s operations. Such restrictions can be announced with little or no advance notice and the Company 
may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, 
including the U.S. and China, have in the past led to tariffs and other restrictions being imposed on the Company’s business. If 
disputes and conflicts further escalate in the future, actions by governments in response could be significantly more severe and 
restrictive  and  could  materially  adversely  affect  the  Company’s  business.  Political  uncertainty  surrounding  trade  and  other 
international disputes could also have a negative effect on consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the 
Company’s business.
Many of the Company’s operations and facilities, as well as critical business operations of the Company’s suppliers and contract 
manufacturers, are in locations that are prone to earthquakes and other natural disasters. In addition, such operations and 
facilities are subject to the risk of interruption by fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial 
accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health 
issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’s control. Global climate 
change is resulting in certain types of natural disasters, such as droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more 
frequently or with more intense effects. Such events can make it difficult or impossible for the Company to manufacture and 
deliver products to its customers, create delays and inefficiencies in the Company’s supply and manufacturing chain, and result 
in  slowdowns  and  outages  to  the  Company’s  service  offerings,  and  negatively  impact  consumer  spending  and  demand  in 
affected  areas.  Following  an  interruption  to  its  business,  the  Company  can  require  substantial  recovery  time,  experience 
significant expenditures to resume operations, and lose significant sales. Because the Company relies on single or limited 
sources for the supply and manufacture of many critical components, a business interruption affecting such sources would 
exacerbate any negative consequences to the Company.
The Company’s operations are also subject to the risks of industrial accidents at its suppliers and contract manufacturers. While 
the Company’s suppliers are required to maintain safe working environments and operations, an industrial accident could occur 
and could result in serious injuries or loss of life, disruption to the Company’s business, and harm to the Company’s reputation. 
Major public health issues, including pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected, and could in the 
future materially adversely affect, the Company due to their impact on the global economy and demand for consumer products; 
the imposition of protective public safety measures, such as stringent employee travel restrictions and limitations on freight 
services and the movement of products between regions; and disruptions in the Company’s operations, supply chain and sales 
and distribution channels, resulting in interruptions to the supply of current products and offering of existing services, and delays 
in production ramps of new products and development of new services.
While the Company maintains insurance coverage for certain types of losses, such insurance coverage may be insufficient to 
cover all losses that may arise.
Global  markets  for  the  Company’s  products  and  services  are  highly  competitive  and  subject  to  rapid  technological 
change, and the Company may be unable to compete effectively in these markets.
The  Company’s  products  and  services  are  offered  in  highly  competitive  global  markets  characterized  by  aggressive  price 
competition  and  resulting  downward  pressure  on  gross  margins,  frequent  introduction  of  new  products  and  services,  short 
product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement in product price and performance characteristics, rapid 
adoption of technological advancements by competitors, and price sensitivity on the part of consumers and businesses.
The Company’s ability to compete successfully depends heavily on ensuring the continuing and timely introduction of innovative 
new products, services and technologies to the marketplace. The Company designs and develops nearly the entire solution for 
its products, including the hardware, operating system, numerous software applications and related services. As a result, the 
Company must make significant investments in R&D. There can be no assurance these investments will achieve expected 
returns, and the Company may not be able to develop and market new products and services successfully.

The Company currently holds a significant number of patents, trademarks and copyrights and has registered, and applied to 
register,  additional  patents,  trademarks  and  copyrights.  In  contrast,  many  of  the  Company’s  competitors  seek  to  compete 
primarily through aggressive pricing and very low cost structures, and by imitating the Company’s products and infringing on 
its  intellectual  property.  Effective  intellectual  property  protection  is  not  consistently  available  in  every  country  in  which  the 
Company operates. If the Company is unable to continue to develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins or if 
competitors infringe on the Company’s intellectual property, the Company’s ability to maintain a competitive advantage could be 
materially adversely affected.
The Company has a minority market share in the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets. The Company faces 
substantial  competition  in  these  markets  from  companies  that  have  significant  technical,  marketing,  distribution  and  other 
resources,  as  well  as  established  hardware,  software  and  digital  content  supplier  relationships.  In  addition,  some  of  the 
Company’s  competitors  have  broader  product  lines,  lower-priced  products  and  a  larger  installed  base  of  active  devices. 
Competition has been particularly intense as competitors have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. Certain 
competitors have the resources, experience or cost structures to provide products at little or no profit or even at a loss. Some of 
the markets in which the Company competes have from time to time experienced little to no growth or contracted overall.
Additionally, the Company faces significant competition as competitors imitate the Company’s product features and applications 
within their products or collaborate to offer solutions that are more competitive than those they currently offer. The Company also 
expects competition to intensify as competitors imitate the Company’s approach to providing components seamlessly within their 
offerings or work collaboratively to offer integrated solutions.
The  Company’s  services  also  face  substantial  competition,  including  from  companies  that  have  significant  resources  and 
experience and have established service offerings with large customer bases. The Company competes with business models 
that provide content to users for free. The Company also competes with illegitimate means to obtain third-party digital content 
and applications.
The  Company’s  business,  results  of  operations  and  financial  condition  depend  substantially  on  the  Company’s  ability  to 
continually improve its products and services to maintain their functional and design advantages. There can be no assurance the 
Company will be able to continue to provide products and services that compete effectively.
Business Risks
To remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions 
and transitions of products and services.
Due to the highly volatile and competitive nature of the markets and industries in which the Company competes, the Company 
must  continually  introduce  new  products,  services  and  technologies,  enhance  existing  products  and  services,  effectively 
stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition to these new 
and upgraded products and services. The success of new product and service introductions depends on a number of factors, 
including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’s ability to manage the risks associated with new 
technologies and production ramp-up issues, the availability of application software for the Company’s products, the effective 
management of purchase commitments and inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products 
in appropriate quantities and at expected costs to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may 
have  quality  or  other  defects  or  deficiencies.  There  can  be  no  assurance  the  Company  will  successfully  manage  future 
introductions and transitions of products and services.
The  Company  depends  on  component  and  product  manufacturing  and  logistical  services  provided  by  outsourcing 
partners, many of which are located outside of the U.S.
Substantially all of the Company’s manufacturing is performed in whole or in part by outsourcing partners located primarily in 
China  mainland,  India,  Japan,  South  Korea,  Taiwan  and  Vietnam,  and  a  significant  concentration  of  this  manufacturing  is 
currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Changes or additions to the Company’s 
supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also 
outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also 
reduce the Company’s direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time to time and may in 
the future have an adverse effect on the quality or quantity of products manufactured or services provided, or adversely affect the 
Company’s flexibility to respond to changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for 
product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible to the consumer for warranty and out-of-
warranty service in the event of product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time to time. While 
the Company relies on its partners to adhere to its supplier code of conduct, violations of the supplier code of conduct occur from 
time to time and can materially adversely affect the Company’s business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.
